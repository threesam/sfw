// Bot guard for the newsletter endpoint.
//
// Junk signups kept landing on the list because the endpoint's only
// check was `if (!email)` — `{"email":"x"}` was a valid submission and anything
// gmail-shaped went straight through. Three layers now, different in kind:
// (kept in step with laila-client's copy apart from formatting.)
//
//   rate limit  every request from one address, whatever shape it takes
//   shape       a malformed or oversized address never reaches listmonk
//   honeypot    a field only an automated filler will populate
//
// The rate limit is a REQUEST-level concern, the other two are PAYLOAD-level, so
// they are separate exports. The route calls isRateLimited() before reading the
// body: counting after the parse let malformed floods buy parse work untracked.
//
// SILENT vs VISIBLE is the line that matters most here, and it is about who can
// trip a check, not how bad the check is. A silent rejection tells the sender
// nothing — which is right for a bot and catastrophic for a person, because it
// reports success while doing nothing. So silence is reserved for the single
// check no real visitor can trip: a honeypot that was actually FILLED. A missing
// one is refused visibly, because a page open since before a deploy sends none.
//
// A submit-timing trap was written and then removed for failing that test: a
// password manager can beat any human-plausible threshold, silently. The
// honeypot field is named to avoid the same trap from the other direction —
// `company` is an autofill target, so it is not called that. See $lib/honeypot.
