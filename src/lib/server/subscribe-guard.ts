// Bot guard for the newsletter endpoint.
//
// The list has been collecting junk signups — well-formed gmail addresses, so
// listmonk accepted every one. The endpoint's only check was `if (!email)`,
// which meant `{"email":"x"}` was a valid submission and anything gmail-shaped
// went straight onto the list.
//
// Three layers, deliberately different in KIND: a bot that defeats one layer
// usually defeats every other layer of the same kind.
//
//   rate limit  every request from one address, whatever shape it takes
//   shape       a malformed or oversized address never reaches listmonk
//   honeypot    a field only an automated filler will populate
//
// The rate limit is a REQUEST-level concern and the other two are PAYLOAD-level,
// so they are separate exports. The route calls isRateLimited() before it reads
// the body at all: counting after the parse meant a flood of huge or malformed
// bodies bought parse work before anything throttled it, and an unparseable body
// was answered without ever being counted.
//
// SILENT vs VISIBLE rejection is the other line that matters here, and it is not
// about severity — it is about who can trip the check.
//
//   silent   only for a check a real person CANNOT trip. A filled honeypot is
//            the only one that qualifies: nobody types into an off-screen field.
//            The bot gets a normal 200 and learns nothing.
//   visible  everything else, including a MISSING honeypot. A page that was
//            already open when this deployed still posts the old payload, and a
//            direct API caller sends no honeypot either. Answering those
//            silently would tell a real visitor they subscribed when they did
//            not; an error they can recover from with a refresh is strictly
//            better, and it still refuses the direct caller.
//
// A submit-timing trap was written and then removed: a password manager filling
// the field can beat any human-plausible threshold, and it fails silently, so it
// could lose real subscribers invisibly to catch bots the honeypot already gets.
//
// No SvelteKit imports on purpose: everything here is a pure function of its
// arguments, so the whole guard is testable without a request or a server.
//
// Kept in step with laila-client's copy apart from formatting — the two sites
// share this endpoint's lineage and the same list host.
