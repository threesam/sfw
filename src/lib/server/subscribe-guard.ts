// Bot guard for the newsletter endpoint.
//
// The list picked up junk signups steadily — well-formed gmail addresses, so
// listmonk accepted every one. The endpoint's only check was `if (!email)`,
// which meant `{"email":"x"}` was a valid submission and anything gmail-shaped
// went straight onto the list.
//
// Four layers, cheapest first, deliberately different in KIND: a bot that
// defeats one layer usually defeats every other layer of the same kind.
//
//   shape       a malformed or oversized address never reaches listmonk
//   honeypot    a field only an automated filler will populate
//   time-trap   nobody finds this form and submits it inside 1.5 seconds
//   rate limit  the only layer still standing if a bot skips the form and
//               POSTs this endpoint directly
//
// No SvelteKit imports on purpose: everything here is a pure function of its
// arguments, so the whole guard is testable without a request or a server.
//
// Kept byte-for-byte in step with laila-client's copy apart from formatting —
// the two sites share this endpoint's lineage and the same list host.

// time-trap rejection is SILENT, so a real person who trips it is told they
// subscribed and never does. Bots submit in tens of milliseconds, so 1.5s
// already clears them by more than an order of magnitude, and no human lands
// on a page, finds the field, fills it — autofill included — and clicks inside
// it. Buying a wider margin against bots by silently losing subscribers is the
